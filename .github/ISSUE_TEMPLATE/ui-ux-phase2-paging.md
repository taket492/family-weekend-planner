## Background
Large result sets need paging to improve performance and scannability.

## Options
- Infinite scroll with intersection observer
- Classic pagination with page size (e.g., 24) and controls

## Acceptance Criteria
- Stable scroll and preserved filters across pages/loads.
- Loading indicators between pages; no duplicate items.

## Affected Files
- `src/components/SpotList.tsx`
- Store/API as needed for page parameters

## Checklist
- [ ] Decide infinite vs pagination
- [ ] Implement with loading states
- [ ] Verify with >200 items (mock if needed)
